"""
test_chat_language_routing.py
Tests for Chatbot Language Routing:
- Chatbot replies in Bangla (বাংলা) by default.
- When user writes in Romanized Bengali (Banglish) or Bengali script,
  language resolves to 'bn' (even if client UI language is set to 'en').
- When user writes fully in English, language resolves to 'en'.
- Proper prompt directives are generated.
- Safety guard correctly propagates the resolved language.
